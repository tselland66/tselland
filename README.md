## What Is This? 

This is a user guide on me.  Hopefully it accelerates the process of getting to know me, learning what you can expect from me and some preferences for how I like to work.  This is a living document that I will continue to update. 

*Disclaimer: This document only applies to me, and in no way should be considered to apply to anyone else at Target.*  

## My Role 

At the highest level, I think I have two primary responsibilities: 

**Build Strong Teams with Happy and Productive People**
- My first and most important job is you.
- Build high performing, diverse and inclusive engineering teams. 
- Foster a culture that people want to be a part of. 
- Provide context and visibility to connect the dots and maximize value and productivity.
- Be committed to the growth and happiness of you.

**Support a Product Portfolio within Target**
- Accountable for the long term health, value, and vision of the technology in our product portfolio.
- Represent the teams and products in organizational discussions and decisions. 
- Ensure the work our teams are doing aligns to the organizational strategies, priorities, dependencies, and budget.
- Give credit and provide recognition for team/individual successes and wins, be accountable when expectations aren't met.

## How I Like to Work & What I Care About
- I subscribe to servant leadership. We work together for Target. You don't work for me. 
- I care more that each of you are happy and engaged in your work than I do about product deliverables and timelines.  If you aren't any of those things, please tell me and I will happily help you find find something at Target that meets your needs.
- I expect our teams to do good work and build high quality solutions that add value to Target. Let me know if there is something preventing you from accomplishing that. 
- I respect and appreciate people that leave their titles at the door, give everyone a voice to bring up new ideas or debate topics, and do whatever it takes to get something done regardless of how shiny/dull the work is.
- If I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job let me know
- If I or anyone else does anything that makes you want to leave the team/Target, tell me about it before you take action.
- I will give you feedback if I think I can help you improve in some way.  Please do the same for me. 
- I will always be as transparent as possible.  Tell me if you don't think I am. 
- Work-life balance is a big deal to me.  Work-life balance means different things to different people.  For me, it means:  schedule flexibility, choosing where I work, and logging off most days around 5 to exercise and spend time with my family. I will do my best to help support what that means for you.    
- I do not expect anyone to work on the weekends. Emergencies may happen and we'll deal with those when they come up, but don't feel like you "owe" me or Target your free time.

## Communication 
- If it's an urgent or an emergency, you can contact me 24x7.
- Slack / email / text are the best during working hours.  I try to respond as quickly as possible.  
- I typically do not monitor Slack or email after hours. 
- Anybody should feel free to stop by my "desk" (virtual or when I am at TNC) or set up a meeting if you want to chat.
- I try to avoid Slacking/emailing off hours.  In the cases where I do, I don't expect anyone to respond until the next business day.

## Your Career and Development 
- You own your career and development.  I’ll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it will be up to you to seize them.  I am here to help and support you in any way possible to achieve your goals.  
- I prefer you to schedule career/development conversations. If you think you are ready for a promotion, be ready to show me examples of you meeting the requirements for the level you think you are functioning at. I will check in with you regularly if you want or need more structure regarding these conversations.
- Continuous learning is something you should do for yourself, not for Target.  There will be plenty of opportunities to learn at work, but I value people that invest in their learning outside of work as well. 

## 1:1's 
- These meetings are for you, and you can drive the agenda. I might throw in a topic or question too.  I also like to chat about non-work related topics to get to know you better. If we spend all our time talking about "life" then so be it.  
- If it's important or urgent, don't wait for your 1:1 with me.  You can always "stop by" or ping me in Slack, or send an email.   
- I prefer to never cancel a 1:1 with you. My time listening to you is the most important meeting I have.

## My Location / Availability / Hours 
- I am a Hybrid worker that loves to work a majority of the time from home. I am usually at TNC (Building E, 3rd floor) every Wednesday.
- Most days I am online by 9:00 am and leave around 5:00 pm.
- My days are often filled with meetings.  Please don’t let that deter you from contacting me if we need to talk.  I am willing to clear calendar space if needed. 

## Personal Quirks 
- I am a middle-middle introvert/extrovert.  I enjoy talking and meeting people, even in person - but also need time to myself. I appreciate and understand the need for quiet in order to get engineering work done.
- I have a lot of hobbies and am older than most of you - I have done a lot of things on my life and have a lot of experiences under my belt.
- If I am quiet in a meeting, especially meetings with large groups and/or with other people that dominate the conversation, don't take my silence to mean I am not engaged or don't have opinions.  I will speak up if I disagree or have an opinion that hasn't already been shared, otherwise I don't feel obligated to speak. 
- I am not always great at thinking or speaking on the spot.  I usually prefer to have time to digest information and develop thoughts on how to respond.
- Once upon a time, I had a real 12x12 office with a door and a window with a view. That was one of the most productive times of my career.
